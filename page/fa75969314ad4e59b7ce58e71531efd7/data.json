If the water is not clean it can be purified using low-cost solutions at home. It can be (1) boiled, (2) cleaned through a filter, (3) purified with chlorine or (4) disinfected with sunlight or other simple measures.10&nbsp;The trained health worker or extension agent should have information on home treatments that are available locally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Safe water sources include properly constructed and maintained piped systems, public standpipes, boreholes, pond sand filters, protected dug wells, protected springs and rainwater collection. Water from unsafe sources &ndash; rivers, dams, lakes, ponds, streams, canals, irrigation channels, unprotected wells and springs &ndash; is best avoided. If necessary it can be made safer by the home-based water treatment methods referred to above.
