The real danger is the loss of liquid and nutrients from the child&#39;s body, which can cause dehydration and malnutrition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A child with diarrhoea should never be given any tablets, antibiotics or other medicines unless prescribed by a trained health worker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best treatment for diarrhoea is to (1) drink lots of liquids and oral rehydration salts (ORS), properly mixed with clean water from a safe source, and (2) take zinc tablets or syrup for 10&ndash;14 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ORS Solution</strong><br />\r\n<span>A special drink for diarrhoea</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is ORS? </strong><br />\r\nORS (oral rehydration salts) is a special combination of dry salts that is mixed with safe water. It can help replace the fluids lost due to diarrhoea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>When should ORS be used?</strong><br />\r\nWhen a child has three or more loose stools in a day, begin to give ORS. In addition, for 10&ndash;14 days, give children over 6 months of age 20 milligrams of zinc per day (tablet or syrup); give children under 6 months of age 10 milligrams per day (tablet or syrup).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Where can ORS be obtained?</strong><br />\r\nIn most countries, ORS packets are available from health centres, pharmacies, markets and shops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How is the ORS drink prepared?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><span>Put the contents of the ORS packet in a clean container. Check the packet for directions and add the correct amount of clean water. Too little water could make the diarrhoea worse.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span>Add water only. Do not add ORS to milk, soup, fruit juice or soft drinks. Do not add sugar.</span></li>\r\n\t<li><span>Stir well, and feed it to the child from a clean cup. Do not use a bottle.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How much ORS drink to give?</strong><br />\r\n<span>Encourage the child to drink as much as possible.</span><br />\r\n<span>A child under the age of 2 years needs at least 1/4 to 1/2 of a large (250-millilitre) cup of the ORS drink after each watery stool.</span><br />\r\n<span>A child aged 2 years or older needs at least 1/2 to 1 whole large (250-millilitre) cup of the ORS drink after each watery stool.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What if ORS is not available?</strong><br />\r\n<span>Give the child a drink made with 6 level teaspoons of sugar and 1/2 level teaspoon of salt dissolved in 1 litre of clean water.</span><br />\r\n<span>Be very careful to mix the correct amounts. Too much sugar can make the diarrhoea worse. Too much salt can be extremely harmful to the child.</span><br />\r\n<span>Making the mixture a little too diluted (with more than 1 litre of clean water) is not harmful.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Diarrhoea usually stops in three or four days.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If it does not stop, consult a trained health worker.</strong></p>\r\n", "published": true, "primary_category": "9051e24578f9416b8fdd9a7fd9b5974d"}, "model": "Page"}
