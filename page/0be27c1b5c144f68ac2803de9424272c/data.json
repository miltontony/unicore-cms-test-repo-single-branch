The more numerous the watery stools, the more dangerous the diarrhoea.<br />\r\nSome people think that drinking liquids makes diarrhoea worse. This is not true. A child with diarrhoea should be given drinks, including breastmilk, as often as possible. Drinking lots of liquids helps to replace the fluids lost during diarrhoea.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>Recommended drinks for a child with diarrhoea include:</strong>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>breastmilk (mothers should breastfeed more often than usual)</li>\r\n\t<li>oral rehydration salts (ORS) mixed with the proper amount of clean water</li>\r\n\t<li>soups</li>\r\n\t<li>rice water</li>\r\n\t<li>fresh fruit juices</li>\r\n\t<li>coconut water</li>\r\n\t<li>clean water from a safe source. If there is a possibility the water is not clean and safe to drink, it should be purified by boiling, filtering, adding chlorine or disinfecting with sunlight in accordance with information provided by a trained health worker or extension agent.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>To avoid dehydration, breastfed children should breastfeed as often as possible.

A feeding bottle should not be used. It is difficult to clean bottles completely, and unclean bottles can contain germs that cause diarrhoea.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>If the child vomits, the caregiver should wait 10 minutes and then begin again to give the drink to the child slowly, small sips at a time.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>The child should be given extra liquids in addition to regular foods and drinks until the diarrhoea has stopped.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Diarrhoea usually stops after three or four days.
